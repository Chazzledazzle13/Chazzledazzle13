- 👋 Hi, I’m @Chazzledazzle13
- 👀 I’m interested in finding an entry level Data Analyst position where I can showcase my skills as well as have the ability to keep developing them. 
- 🌱 I’m currently polishing my knowledge on SQL, Tableau, R, and Excel. These are skills that I think are well developed, 
but I still would like to feel 110% confident in my abilities with these skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any and all projects that can help polish my abilities and make me a more enticing candidate for positions.
